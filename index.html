So I got tired of dealing with huge frameworks and looked back longingly 
at the heady days of late 1990 when folk shared the content of a "www" folder 
and marked up their content in basic ways to make it navigable and intelligible. 
So just for fun, this page is not even compatible with HTML3.2 for now. 
Let's see what happens when you travel very light indeed

Analog is the baby that was thrown out with the digital bath-water.

I should know, I was one of the original guilty parties 
in the early days of the commercial internet in the UK. 
If we could turn it into a client-server application, we went for it.

I'm not sure exactly when it happened but we feel there is now 
something missing between the human and the digital.

So now, after years of expecting the next digital experience to be 
the one, we've decided it was time to look back at the stored knowledge 
of analog devices.

We've set up Human Systems Ltd as an studio for prototyping 
real-world services and digital+analog devices with the intention 
of crowdsourcing the better outcomes to market.

Service design was never meant to mean digital-only 
so hopefully we'll have real physical devices in your hands soon:-).
