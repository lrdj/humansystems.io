I"é<p>Analog is the baby that was thrown out with the digital bath-water.</p>

<p>I should know, I was one of the original guilty parties 
in the early days of the commercial internet in the UK. 
If we could turn it into a client-server application, we went for it.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m not sure exactly when it happened but we feel there is now 
something missing between the human and the digital.</p>

<p>So now, after years of expecting the next digital experience to be 
the one, weâ€™ve decided it was time to look back at the stored knowledge 
of analog devices.</p>

<p>Weâ€™ve set up Human Systems Ltd as an studio for prototyping 
real-world services and digital+analog devices with the intention 
of crowdsourcing the better outcomes to market.</p>

<p>Service design was never meant to mean digital-only 
so hopefully weâ€™ll have real physical devices in your hands soon:-).</p>
