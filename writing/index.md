## Conditions I like to work in

A lot of service design is helping people navigate sometimes difficult or inconvenient truths. This works best when the people believe in the service design team and trust is established as early as possible. 

This means I like to work in a team where I don't have to think twice before asking a question or reaching out to someone. This also means I need to leverage face-to-face and workshop facilitation time as much as possible, so this will be a huge challenge in our current project. I’m thinking we’ll need to engineer one to one calls as well as our big set-pieces...

### The times/hours I like to work

I operate best in different modes at different times.

- I need "stare out the window" time for ideas to percolate
- I need high energy social time to co-design
- I need quiet "do not disturb" time to read and do desk research
- I need time to recover from conference call burnout

These modes don't map one-to-one with times of the day and since lockdown most of my standard clocks have been disrupted. Currently my day is looking a bit like this

06:00 - 11:00 Kids still in bed, good 'doing' time
11:00 - 15:00 Have a desk space claimed for this period so good for listening in on video calls
21:00 - 02:00 Best time for synthesizing complexity and report writing

I'm trying to keep my hours to a sensible maximum (flexi?) so I am spreading them across those periods.

### The best ways to communicate with me

I like short emails but I also like the journalism technique "assume your reader is intelligent but knows nothing". If you ask me to do something in an email but don't give me all the details, that can lock up my thinking.

I have no channel preference but I find WhatsApp very handy. I find Slack with too many channels a problem.

I am here to help and support my team’s success so always ask for help the moment you think you’ll need it:-)

### The ways I like to receive feedback

Feedback is super important to me.

I welcome feedback given constructively in a retro format (stop doing this; continue doing this; try doing this). It's best when it happens as soon as possible. Less in love with big after-the-fact wash-up sessions.

If you thought we worked well together, I also like Linkedin recommendations.

### Things I need

Kindness, patience, engagement.

### Things I struggle with

- Being told that something is outside of "my gift"
- Refusing to try something
- Resistance to exploring the unknown

### Things I love
- That moment when we change the frame and all the lights go on as the opportunities for the customer line up on the roadmap:-)
- Typography
- My 20-year-old truck
- Making things

### Other things to know about me

I just conducted a program of user research in Paris in French, which was a bit mental but very exciting (I grew up in Paris).

A few years ago I died briefly (motorcycle accident) and was saved by the NHS (thank you NHS)

I’m a paddler (canoe). Currently quite stressed at not being able to put my boat in the water.
