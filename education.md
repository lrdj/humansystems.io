Analog is the baby that was thrown out with the digital bath-water.
preamble: I should know, I was one of the original guilty parties in the early days of the commercial internet in the UK. If we could turn it into a client-server application, we went for it.

I'm not sure exactly when it happened, but we feel there is now something missing between the human and the digital.

So now, after years of expecting the next digital experience to be the one, we've decided it was time to look back at the stored knowledge of analog devices.

We've set up Human Systems Ltd as a studio for prototyping real-world services and digital+analog devices with the intention of crowdsourcing the better outcomes to market. 

Service design was never meant to mean digital-only so hopefully we'll have real physical devices in your hands soon:-)
