# Your mission 
_(should you choose to accept it)_

Please visit the National Museum of Scotland (aka _the museum of interesting things_). It's 5 mins walk from here.

![It's 5 mins walk from here](map.jpg)

Your mission is to:

- Find something interesting to bring back and chat about in the
pub
- (optionally) assess the impact of AI on the enjoyment of
experiences generally
- Share your opinions (what you think that means) with your colleagues

You might say using ChatGPT should be banned from quizzes, and you could be right. But what if it was mandatory?

There will be many ways to find the answers to these questions. Some may require visiting the museum, but many, if not all of them could be found using Google and AI. If the internet generally, or ChatGPT specifically, means we can cheat in all our quizzes, how can we make them fun or maybe even worthwhile?

It's a question I want us to consider. If you don't have enough time to fully discuss all the questions you will consider, please bring them back with you and continue later:-)

**So up to you how you play** You can rush to the Museum, or you could rush to a café or pub, it's up to you to decide. Whatever you decide, it should be interesting to hear what you learn.

You have 2 hours from this briefing to complete the following tasks. Please get back to the Three Sisters pub by 15:30.



## Task 1

Please send two volunteers from your team to the roof
terrace on the 7th floor.
They should bring back the answer to this question:
What structure lies at bearing 337° from the viewing
platform?


## Task 2

Send half of your remaining team to the Art, Design
and Fashion galleries on level five (see map).
They should bring back an example of where design
assumptions might lead to creating inaccessible
services or products.

1. What is the thing?
2. Why is it meaningful in accessibility terms?


## Task 3

Please send the other half of your team to the
"Animal Senses" gallery on level three (see map).
Hanging from the ceiling is a creature that can both
swim faster than you, and run faster than you. This
creature would struggle on a bicycle.

1. What is this creature?
2. Can you imagine a context where it would ride a bicycle?


## Task 4

Regroup your team in one of two locations. Either the café in the basement next to the exit, or the "Balcony Café" (see map).

Please all chip in and buy your two colleagues who went to the viewing platform a cake. Or two cakes. They have now walked the whole length of the museum and will need a boost to be able to tell the team about all things they have not seen

_[Time check: About 45 minutes from leaving the 3
Sisters, team captains (or team time-keeper - need
to assign - should start gathering their teams in the
café]_


## Task 5

As a team (or two tables if your team is very large)

please discuss the following:

The Museum is filled with objects that are purely artistic, ethnographic or commercial. Have you seen an object today whose success during its lifetime could be described in terms of:

1. Why did people really like it, want it or buy it? (was it desirable? Why?)
2. How was the creation of this object technically feasible (was it cutting edge tech? A new use of old tech? A creative approach to a physical or mechanical problem?) Did tech cause its downfall?
3. If it was a hard to make object, either because it was large, or complex, or used rare materials etc, to what degree did it succeed (or fail) because of its financial viability?

As an example, there is a fragment of a steel girder from the bridge _"over the silvery Tay"_ in the "Industry and Empire" galleries. The story of that girder could be told in three chapters, following the themes above.

Please think of an object in the Museum and describe it in those terms.


## Task 6

Something in this museum of interesting things was more interesting than the other things. Assuming you could have anything in the museum to take home with you, what would it be?

1. What would your team take home with
them today?
2. Why did you pick this thing?


## Task 7

Collate all your answers to the above questions (write them down so you can refer to them later).

Reflect on what vou've done so far in this exercise, and prepare your presentation. When your team comes back to the pub, you'll have 5 minutes to tell your colleagues what you experienced.

As part of your presentation, if some of your team members used Google or ChatGPT to answer the questions, please include thoughts on how your team's experience of the task was impacted by the existence of ChatGPT (did it make it more fun? Less?).

Please identify three interesting things that you experienced today. Write them down and be prepared to explain your findings to your colleagues

1. Thing one
2. Thing two
3. Thing three


## Extra credit questions (no points but possibly fun)

1. what was the scariest thing you saw and why?

2. The hot air balloons are tethered magnetically.
When the launch button turns red, clicking on it sends
the balloon up to the roof

  - Why do you think they are tethered?
  - What would happen if they weren't?

3. Can you take a photo of two team members with
the Scottish Widow?

4. Can you take a portrait of every team member
wearing a space suit?

5. Which Thunderbird spacecraft did Scott base his
monument on?

6. What was "Kissing the Maiden"?


Thanks!
