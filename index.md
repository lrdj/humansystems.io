So I got tired of dealing with huge frameworks and looked back longingly 
at the heady days of late 1990 when folk shared the content of a "www" folder 
and marked up their content in basic ways to make it navigable and intelligible. 
So just for fun, this page is not even compatible with HTML3.2 for now. 
Let's see what happens when you travel very light indeed

Analog is the baby that was thrown out with the digital bath-water.

I should know, I was one of the original guilty parties in the early days of the commercial internet in the UK. If we could turn it into a client-server application, we whent for it.

But now, after years of expecting the next digital experience to be the one, we decided it was time to look back at analog devices.

We've set up Human Systems Ltd as an studio for prototyping real-world services and digital+analog devices with the intention of crowdsourcing the better outcomes to market.

Service design was never meant to mean digital-only so hopefully we'll have real physical devices in your hands soon:-). 

I'm not sure exactly when that happened but we feel there is now something missing between the human and the digital.


Cheers,
Dug
